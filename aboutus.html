                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p> SugarBomb conceptualized in 2015 in the United Kingdom when the founders met, where idea and direction of the company was discussed. What started as a perfume brand, has since expanded into producing other noteworthy products such as air-fresheners, hand sanitizers, and various other merchandises.</p>

                    <p>The origin of SugarBomb is derived from two different words, ‘Sugar’ and ‘Bomb’ representing the best in the perfumery. Together it signifies ‘sweet fragrance that will blast the perfume industry’. </p>
